<b>Simple.</b> Ollama. UI Portal. Powered by Flask &amp; Javascript.
## Tell me more.
Soupsnake is a user-friendly interface designed to simplify interactions with AI through Ollama, eliminating the need for terminal commands. Built with Flask and JavaScript, Soupsnake offers a lightweight and fast application that balances simplicity with robust features.

Targeted at users seeking an intuitive and easy-to-run solution, Soupsnake streamlines the AI experience by providing a seamless, efficient, and accessible platform for inquiries and interactions.

It features:
- :white_check_mark: A simple yet comfortable UI.
- :white_check_mark: Allows you to choose local models via a dropdown.
- :white_check_mark: AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI support
- :white_check_mark: Lightweight and performant.


## Planned Updates.
> [!IMPORTANT]
Due to my fairly busy life, soupsnake doesn't have constant updates like other WebUI's. It's updated whenever I can do so, however, there are features I do plan to add such as.

- <b><i>List is ordered by priority.</b></i>

- [ ] Refactor design and code oversights to make soupsnake far more fluid to interact with.
- [ ] Implement chat history so that conversations can be more fluid.
- [ ] Refactor CSS and HTML to properly support Safari.
- [ ] Support for pulling models for ollama via the UI
- [ ] A menu which allows you to change options for both the LLM and Generative AI Image model. Such as steps or warmth.

## Why soupsnake?
I've come to realize that many UI options for Ollama tend to be aimed towards more advanced users, while nothing is wrong with that, I aimed to design an app that is as simple as possible to get up and running and requires no configuring. soupsnake isn't the best UI option out there, but it is simple and easy to get up and running.
