## Tell me more.
Soupsnake is a user-friendly interface designed to simplify interactions with AI through Ollama, eliminating the need for terminal commands. Built with Flask and JavaScript, Soupsnake offers a lightweight and fast application that balances simplicity with robust features.

- :white_check_mark: Lightweight and performant.


## Planned Updates.
> [!IMPORTANT]
Due to my fairly busy life, soupsnake doesn't have constant updates like other WebUI's. It's updated whenever I can do so, however, there are features I do plan to add such as.

- <b><i>List is ordered by priority.</b></i>

- [ ] Refactor design and code oversights to make soupsnake far more fluid to interact with.
- [ ] Refactor CSS and HTML to properly support Safari.
- [ ] Implement chat history so that conversations can be more fluid.
- [ ] Support for pulling models for ollama via the UI
- [ ] A menu which allows you to change options for both the LLM and Generative AI Image model. Such as steps or warmth.

## Why soupsnake?
I've come to realize that many UI options for Ollama tend to be aimed towards more advanced users, while nothing is wrong with that, I aimed to design an app that is as simple as possible to get up and running and requires no configuring. soupsnake isn't the best UI option out there, but it is simple and easy to get up and running.
